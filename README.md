AI Project (Machine Learning Classification)
Technologies: Java, NetBeans, GUI
Date: March 2024

Overview
This project involves the development of an application that addresses binary and multi-class classification problems using machine learning algorithms. Classification is a type of machine learning problem where data points are categorized into one of two or more classes. In this project, the application is designed to handle up to four categories for classification tasks.

Features
Binary Classification: Categorizes data into two classes.
Multi-Class Classification: Handles classification into up to four different categories.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using Java Swing for an intuitive user experience, allowing users to interact with the application easily.
Machine Learning: Implements machine learning algorithms to train models and classify data based on the given inputs.
Tools & Technologies
Java: The primary programming language used for application development.
NetBeans: Integrated development environment (IDE) used to build and run the project.
Java Swing (GUI): For building the graphical user interface of the application.
How It Works
The user inputs data into the GUI.
The application processes the data using a classification algorithm (can be customized based on the algorithm used in the actual project).
The application classifies the data points into one of the predefined classes (binary or multi-class).
The output is displayed within the GUI, providing the user with the predicted category.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
نسخ الكود
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AI-Classification-Project.git](https://github.com/fatoom9/AI_repo/tree/master/Ai2_pro)
Open the project in NetBeans.

Run the project by clicking on the Run button in the NetBeans IDE.

Usage
Input your dataset or values into the GUI for classification.
Choose the type of classification (binary or multi-class) based on the problem you wish to solve.
View the results in the output area of the GUI.
