# **AI Project (Machine Learning Classification)**  
**Technologies:** Java, NetBeans, GUI  
**Date:** March 2024  

## **Overview**  
This project involves the development of an application that addresses **binary and multi-class classification problems** using machine learning algorithms. **Classification** is a type of machine learning problem where data points are categorized into one of two or more classes. In this project, the application is designed to handle **up to four categories** for classification tasks.

## **Features**  
- **Binary Classification:** Categorizes data into two classes.  
- **Multi-Class Classification:** Handles classification into up to four different categories.  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built using **Java Swing** for an intuitive user experience, allowing users to interact with the application easily.  
- **Machine Learning:** Implements machine learning algorithms to train models and classify data based on the given inputs.  

## **Tools & Technologies**  
- **Java:** The primary programming language used for application development.  
- **NetBeans:** Integrated development environment (IDE) used to build and run the project.  
- **Java Swing (GUI):** For building the graphical user interface of the application.  

## **How It Works**  
1. The user inputs data into the **GUI**.  
2. The application processes the data using a **classification algorithm** (can be customized based on the algorithm used in the actual project).  
3. The application classifies the data points into one of the predefined classes (**binary or multi-class**).  
4. The output is displayed within the GUI, providing the user with the predicted category.

## **Installation**
